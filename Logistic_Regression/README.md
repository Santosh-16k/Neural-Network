# Logistic Regression

To begin with, I am searching for an interseting dataset for logistic regression classification.

I have finalized with using titanic dataset from kaggle. The aim is to predict which passengers survive based on features like gender, age, fare, etc.

So, I started working using pandas library for exploring the dataset. Then, I worked on a Keras based implementation which contained 10 neurons in the hidden layer followed by a single output layer.
The predictions of the test dataset was uploaded to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). It gave an accuracy of 0.74641. Others have scored until 0.81. So, my result is not the best one but still a good start to begin Neural Networks.
